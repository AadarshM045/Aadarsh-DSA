/*
Problem: 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
Level: Medium

Description:
You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the i-th day.
On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can hold at most one share of the stock at a time.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve.

Example:
Input:  prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 7
Explanation:
- Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 4.
- Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 3.
- Total profit = 4 + 3 = 7.

Approach (Greedy):
- Whenever thereâ€™s an increase from one day to the next, take that profit.
- Sum all positive differences (prices[i] - prices[i-1]).
- This effectively captures all profitable buy-sell opportunities.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
